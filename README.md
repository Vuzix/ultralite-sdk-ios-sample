# Ultralite SDK Sample for iOS
This repo contains two sample sample applications built using the [Ultralite SDK for iOS](https://github.com/Vuzix/UltraliteSDK-releases-iOS).  

SampleApp is a simple application that demonstrates different capabilities you can achieve using the UltraliteSDK.  It shows several example use cases for controlling various types of content on the Vuzix Z100™ smart glasses display.

UltraliteSwiftSample shows an example of a device picker built using SwiftUI.  It also has an example WatchOS app included using the same picker functionality.  The app itself demonstrates how to use the Ultralite.Canvas to draw to z100 glasses. 

This is intended to allow developers to quickly become familiar with the capabilities of the Ultralite SDK, and learn how to easily add support for the Vuzix Z100™ smart glasses in their own applications.
